create a fully-responsive application that meets the needs of one of the fictional clients featured in the Cheatsheet tab of this lesson.



*/ day 2 /*
spend time carefully integrating fluid images with Webpack, as explained inTuesday night's homework. All sites will require images in some capacity, regardless which fictional client you select.

Other Notes
Make sure to thoroughly integrate all concepts of responsive design we've covered thus far. Regardless of the fictional client you select, each site should be incredibly responsive, quickly adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

As soon as you advance beyond the homepage, you can find information on creating multi-page sites with Webpack in the Multi-Page Routing with Webpack lesson.

If/when you're ready to begin integrating images into your design, you can find details about working with images in Webpack-bundled projects in the Images with Webpack lesson.

You'll have three options for in-class on Thursday. One options is extending this two-day project into a three-day project (if it still requires enough work to fully fill a third day.) So, before the end of Wednesday we recommend discussing the project status with your current partner, and determining whether you'd like to continue working for a third day. You can review all of Thursday's classwork options here.
